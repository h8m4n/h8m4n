# Hey M4n! 👋

## Description ✨

This repository is here to save my **Cybersecurity** writeups and documentation content.   
If I do my job correctly, those two will always be linked.

## Structure 🏗️

One repo will gather all documentation: **d4rk-doc**

Other repositories can be:   
- **Writeups**: with the prefix `wrtup_`
- **Projects**: with dedicated names, because it's cooler

## Disclaimer ⚠️

You can spoil yourself if you are reading some writeups. The content might not be as cool as you want or seems to be made by a monkey.

Feel free to create issues to help the repo!
